Scientific Computing Certification Projects by FreeCodeCamp

### Cipher
* Create Caesar and Vigenere cipher text using fundamentals of Python. The Caesar cipher shift each letter in the message by a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. The Vigenere cipher use a keyword to apply different Caesar ciphers to different parts of the message.

### Luhn Algorithm
* Create a function for the Luhn Algorithm. The Luhn algorithm,  is a simple checksum formula used to validate a variety of identification numbers, such as credit card numbers. It doubles every second digit from right to left, adds the digits of the results if they are two digits, subtracts 9 if the result is greater than 9, sums all the digits, and checks if the sum is divisible by 10.

### Snake Case
* Convert into Snake Case from Camel Case or Pascal Case using list comprehension. Snake case uses underscores to separate words (like this_is_snake_case), while camel case capitalizes the first letter of each word except the first (like thisIsCamelCase).

### Password Generator
* Build a password generator program using regular expressions. Regular expressions are like wildcards that provide a concise and flexible means for matching strings of text, such as particular characters, words, or patterns of characters.

### Merge Sort Algorithm
* Interact with data structures by sorting a list of random numbers using the Merge Sort Algorithm.The Merge Sort Algorithm is a sorting algorithm based on the divide and conquer principle. It recursively divides a list into halves, sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves back together.

### Sudoku Solver
* Use classes and objects to build a Sudoku grid and to solve a Sudoku puzzle. Classes and objects are fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP). They provide a way to structure your code by bundling data and functions that operate on that data into meaningful units. Classes are like blueprints for creating objects, which are specific instances of those blueprints with their own unique data.

### Binary Search Tree
* Construct your own BST and perform an in-order traversal using key operations like insertion, search, and deletion. A Binary Search Tree (BST) is an common data structure where data is sorted hierarchically.

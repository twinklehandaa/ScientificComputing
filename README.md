Scientific Computing Certification Projects by FreeCodeCamp

### Cipher
* Create Caesar and Vigenere cipher text using fundamentals of Python. The Caesar cipher shift each letter in the message by a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. The Vigenere cipher use a keyword to apply different Caesar ciphers to different parts of the message.

### Luhn Algorithm
* Create a function for the Luhn Algorithm. The Luhn algorithm,  is a simple checksum formula used to validate a variety of identification numbers, such as credit card numbers. It doubles every second digit from right to left, adds the digits of the results if they are two digits, subtracts 9 if the result is greater than 9, sums all the digits, and checks if the sum is divisible by 10.

### Snake Case
* Convert into Snake Case from Camel Case or Pascal Case using list comprehension. Snake case uses underscores to separate words (like this_is_snake_case), while camel case capitalizes the first letter of each word except the first (like thisIsCamelCase).

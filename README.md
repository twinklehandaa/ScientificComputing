### Cipher
* Create cipher text using fundamentals of Python

### Luhn Algorithm
* The Luhn algorithm, also known as the modulus 10 or mod 10 algorithm, is a simple checksum formula used to validate a variety of identification numbers, such as credit card numbers. It doubles every second digit from right to left, adds the digits of the results if they are two digits, subtracts 9 if the result is greater than 9, sums all the digits, and checks if the sum is divisible by 10.
